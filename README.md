# The "Eight" Game Solver with BFS / DFS 
This program solves the "eight" game, also known as the sliding puzzle, using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-first search (DFS) algorithms. 
The goal of the game is to arrange the numbers in a 3x3 matrix in a specific order by moving a black figure ("sh") up, down, left, or right. 
The black figure cannot jump over the numbers and can only move one square at a time.

BTW "sh" is short for shavi, which means black in Georgian :)
